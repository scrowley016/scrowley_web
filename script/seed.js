The combination of hunger, anger, and nuclear waste turns your once best friends into hangry hangry zombie campers demanding food and looking to attack! In a moment of panic and fear you take your last granola bar and throw it at your friend closest to you. He picks up the granola bar, eats it, and is transformed back into your best friend! Yay! Your mission is now clear. You must travel around the campsite and retrieve the lost food, and then use your handy food launcher (and they said you were crazy to bring it camping) to get the food to your friends and turn them back to save the day!',
